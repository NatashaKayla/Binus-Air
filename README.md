## ✈️ BinusAir - Terminal-Based Flight Booking System (C++)

A simple C++ terminal-based flight reservation system that lets users create, manage, and view flight bookings for both domestic and international routes. Designed for learning purposes, this project demonstrates modular programming, data handling, and menu navigation using standard C++.

---

### 🎯 Main Objectives

* Design a user-friendly terminal interface for booking flight tickets
* Implement core features such as flight creation, booking, and passenger listing
* Store and display reservation data (passenger name, origin, destination)
* Provide a functional menu-driven navigation system using functions and control structures
* Handle basic input validation and conditional logic

---

### 🗂️ Features

* 🛫 **Create New Flight**

  Add domestic or international flights by selecting from a list of valid destinations.

* 📥 **Manage Booking**

  Input passenger name and select a destination to create a flight reservation.

* 📋 **See Passengers**

  Display a list of all passengers with their origin and destination details.

* ❌ **Exit**

  Exit the system gracefully via the menu.

### 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how C++ can be used to build a basic terminal-based application with menu navigation, user input, and conditional processing. It provides a foundational structure for understanding modular programming and simulating real-world systems like flight booking. While simple in nature, this program can be further enhanced with features like data persistence (file or database), input validation improvements, and user authentication.
